**SOLANASIGN**

Solanasign is a decentralized platform for <b>signing and storing contracts between two parties on the Blockchain</b>.<br>
The project started from the necessity of InvestConservation to sign a contract on the blockchain that could prove landowner commitment to tokenizing off-chain carbon.

WHO'S THIS PRODUCT FOR?<br>
Anyone who needs to sign a contract for professional or personal purposes can now use SolanaSign to store and sign a document on the Solana Blockchain. The platform is open and accessible to anyone in possession of a Solana Wallet of any kind.<br>
List of supported wallets:

<ul><li>Phantom</li>
<li>Solflare</li>
<li>Torus</li>
<li>Ledger</li>
<li>Sollet</li>
<li>Slope</li>
<li>Clover</li>
<li>MathWallet</li>
<li>Solong</li>
<li>BitKeep</li>
<li>Coin98</li>
</ul>

HOW DOES IT WORKS?<br>
By visiting <a>https://solanasign.investconservation.com</a> you can connect your wallet to the platform, and then:

<ol>
<li>Create a new contract and invite the other person (or wallet) to sign it.</li>
<li>Visit your contracts list and see if you have a new contract, issued by someone else, to sign.</li>
</ol>

Either publishing a new contract or signing an existing one is going to require you to pay some gas fees. These are going to be used to store the data on the Blockchain. This will provide a lifetime proof of your signing on the blockchain.<br>

You can also share the document with the verified signs just by copying the URL and pasting anywhere else. Only disclaimer, to view a contract signed by anyone you still need to connect a wallet so that the platform will recognize the network.<br>

WHY CHOOSE SOLANASIGN?<br>
By leveraging the power of the Solana Blockchain, SolanaSign is able to give users a simple and straightforward experience for reaching an agreement. The big difference to competitors is that Solanasign is a fully decentralized and trustless solution of storing the contract and the signatures on the blockchain, making these eternal. The signature being confirmed by the blockchain adds another level of security for users.<br>
